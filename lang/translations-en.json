    "home_feature_title_4": "Scanning tests",
    "home_feature_desc_4": "The application enables the digitalization, validation, and recording of incoming exam materials, including tests and identification forms. Each test bag is opened, after which correctly completed tests are scanned, validated, and entered into the system. The same process is applied for digitalizing, validating, and recording identification forms, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.",
    "home_feature_title_5": "Automated processing",
    "home_feature_desc_5": "Through a specially developed application, during the design of tests, the method and number of answer reviews for each question are defined. In the case of multiple reviews, the results are compared, and if there is any discrepancy, the results are reconciled. Answers to multiple-choice questions are automatically graded, while answers to essay questions are assigned to reviewers registered in the system.",
    "home_feature_title_6": "Manual review",
    "home_feature_desc_6": "A special application has been developed and it allows registered reviewers to grade answers to essay questions. Answers are categorized by subject area and test language.

Upon request, candidates can be sent scanned and marked tests via email to have complete access to their answers.",
    "home_feature_title_8": "Online complaints",
    "home_feature_desc_8": "Users are allowed to submit a complaint regarding the number of points earned for each individual question through a specialized portal, and the complaint is automatically recorded in the system. The portal also allows tracking of the complaint status and decisions made by the responsible committees. Depending on the outcome of the complaint, the results will be automatically corrected. In addition to the first-level complaint, users can also file a second-level complaint, which is processed using the same mechanism.",

    "about_testmaster_desc_2": "Taking into account various question formulations, the system supports different question types, such as essay questions (with or without images), multiple-choice questions (with a list of possible answers), as well as fill-in-the-blank questions.",
    "about_testmaster_desc_3": "The system is modular and is being developed in phases. So far, for the needs of the Faculty of Organizational Sciences and the Final Exam at the end of primary education, modules have been developed to support the design of paper-based forms, preparation for printing, scanning of completed forms (i.e., converting them into electronic format), followed by their automatic review, verification, and grading. After completing the results, automatic marking of reviewed tests is performed, and they are made available for review, which involves sending an appropriate email to each candidate, with their reviewed work attached. Automatic marking of tests means that for each scanned form, for each question, the recognized answer is marked, it is indicated whether the answer is correct, and the number of points achieved is recorded.",
